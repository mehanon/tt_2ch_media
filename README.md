## TikTok Downloader for 2ch/media to replace awemer (it sucks, no offence)

It does what the title says. In the best quality you could get with tikwm

### Usage

NOTE: Windows could treat the executable as a virus and block it from internet, 
idk how you fix it on Windows, with administrator rights?

1. Console mode  
`./tt_2ch_media.exe "https://www.tiktok.com/@shrimpydimpy/video/7133412834960018730"`
2. Inline mode (as a classic application) `./tt_2ch_media.exe` or just double-click on windows


### Installation

You could use a pre-built executable or build your own with Golang 1.19.  
You don't have to trust me.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mehanon/tt_2ch_media
cd tt_2ch_media
go build
```
